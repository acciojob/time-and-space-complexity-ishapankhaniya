    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First Paragraph: Time Complexity -->
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size.
        It helps us analyze how efficient an algorithm is. A lower time complexity generally means a more
        efficient algorithm that performs better with large inputs.
    </p>

    <!-- Second Paragraph: Space Complexity -->
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input.
        It is important to consider space usage, especially when working with large datasets or limited memory environments.
        A common example of space complexity is O(n), where the memory required grows linearly with the input size.
